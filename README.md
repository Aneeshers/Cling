## Tech stack

### Flutter

The entire, including the UX/UI, application is built using Flutter and Dart. Flutter was used to interface with Firebase, Alpaca API, and search libraries. Custom Interfaces with Firebase and Alpaca were developed using Dart.

### Alpaca API

The [Alpaca API](https://alpaca.markets) was used to keep track of trades, sensitive financial information, deposits, withdrawls, and tracking group transactions. We interfaced with Alpaca by creating a REST interface in Dart.

### Firebase

Firebase was used to authenticate users, read/write real time user information, post trading proposals, and track group investments. We mainly relied on Firebase's Firestore and Authentication services.
